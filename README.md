PROJECT TITLE:				Comprehensive Analysis of the Human TNF gene
	
OBJECTIVE:						Apply bioinformatics tools like Bioedit, PROMO, and MEME Suite to analyse and intepret the human TNF gene.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMAN TNF GENE:		The human TNF gene is the gene that encodes the TNF protein what is a proinflammatory cytokine.
							This gene encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis 
							factor (TNF) superfamily. This cytokine is mainly secreted by macrophages. It can bind to, and 
							thus functions through its receptors TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and TNFRSF1B/TNFBR. This cytokine is involved 
							in the regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell proliferation, 
							differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. This cytokine has been implicated 
							in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, psoriasis, rheumatoid 
							arthritis ankylosing spondylitis, tuberculosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and 
							cancer. Mutations in this gene affect susceptibility to cerebral malaria, septic shock, and 
							Alzheimer disease. Knockout studies in mice also suggested the neuroprotective function of this 
							cytokine. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]
